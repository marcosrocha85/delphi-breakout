# delphi-breakout
My very first "game" written in Delphi

# FAQ
- Why did you decided to publish that only nowadays?
  Well... I showed up this project to [@eimigueloliveir](https://github.com/eimigueloliveir) and he literally came upset because I was keeping my Delphi projects in a backup folder called "Pendrive" ðŸ¤£. So yeah!!! I decided to bring it to someone who is learning coding or even game principles. I intend to build and release the OpenSource version executable to enjoy you all.
- Where did you learn about build this "game engine"?
  I downloaded a PDF from [@davidferreirafz](https://github.com/davidferreirafz) in 2008 ðŸ˜¶ and learned some concepts. My boss taught me to develop something in Delphi so that's the result. There are many improvements and refactorings to do. So feel free to create pull requests. ðŸ˜…
- Will you sell this game?
  Absolutely not. This is a study case and I suppose that "Breakout" is a trademark. It MUST be used only for educational purproses.
